= How can I track TL;DR generations in analytics? =

TLDRWP dispatches a custom JavaScript event `tldrwp_generated` when a summary is successfully generated. You can listen for this event to track generations in Google Analytics, Plausible, or any other analytics tool.

**Google Analytics 4:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('tldrwp_generated', function(e) {
    gtag('event', 'tldr_generated', {
        article_id: e.detail.articleId,
        article_title: e.detail.articleTitle
    });
});
```

**Plausible Analytics:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('tldrwp_generated', function(e) {
    plausible('TLDR Generated', {
        props: {
            article_id: e.detail.articleId,
            article_title: e.detail.articleTitle
        }
    });
});
```

The event includes: `articleId`, `articleTitle`, `timestamp`, and `platform` data.
